# Normalization for Fitch-style Modal Calculi (Artifact)

This repository contains the artifact accompanying the paper
*Normalization for Fitch-style Modal Calculi*.

## Dependencies

- [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.1/) version 2.6.2.1
- [Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/) version 1.7

## Check

To typecheck the code, run the following command line from the
repository directory:

> agda src/Everything.agda

### Assumptions

The code depends on the following two axioms:

  + Uniqueness of identity proofs (axiom K)
  + Function extensionality

Function extensionality avoids the use of setoids in the soundness
proof for the evaluation function of &lambda;<sub>IK</sub>, and axiom K allows
reasoning about values of the modal accessibility relation using
heterogeneous equality. We expect that both axioms can be dispensed
with.

## Contents

The repository contains the mechanization of the normalization
function for the calculi &lambda;<sub>IK</sub> (`src/IK/`) and &lambda;<sub>IS4</sub>
(`src/IS4/`) as described in the paper.

    + Logical relation (Fig. 9) and fundamental theorem (Proposition 3) → lines 25-39 and 160-192 in `src/IK/Norm/Properties/Soundness/Trace.agda`, respectively
      (Note that the logical relation for &lambda;<sub>IK</sub> in the code is actually set up so that the fundamental theorem implies the stronger adequacy statement `t ⟶* norm t` that terms `t` are reducible to their normal form `norm t` (cf. line 195). This immediately implies the weaker adequacy statement `t ≈ norm t` that terms `t` are equivalent to their normal form `norm t`. Recall that the equational theory `_≈_` can (and is in the code) equivalently be defined as the reflexive&ndash;transitive&ndash;symmetric closure of the "reduction" relation `_⟶_` (`_⟶*_` denotes the merely reflexive&ndash;transitive closure of `_⟶_`). The reduction relation is not defined in the paper and the logical relation for &lambda;<sub>IS4</sub> below is only set up to prove the weaker adequacy statement.)

### Structure of the repository

The following tree gives a brief overview of the structure of the
repository with a brief description of each module.

Every path that follows is under the directory `src/`.

Modules marked with an asterisk * only reexport modules under the
directory with the same name. Modules under the directory usually
consist of a `Base` module, which contains basic definitions, and
(possibly) several other modules with specific content, for example a
`Properties` module.

Modules marked with double asterisk ** instantiate the parameters of
a more general module and export the special instances.

Some modules are shared among the mechanizations of
&lambda;<sub>IK</sub> and &lambda;<sub>IS4</sub>. They contain code
