## Fitch-Style Modal Calculi

Fitch-style modal lambda calculi enable programming with various necessity modalities in a typed lambda calculus. This is achieved by extending the typing context with a delimiting operator that is typically denoted by a lock. The addition of locks simplifies the formulation of typing rules for calculi that incorporate different modal axioms, but each variant demands different, tedious and seemingly ad hoc syntactic lemmas to prove meta-theoretic properties such as normalization. In this work, we study the possible-world semantics and the problem of normalization for Fitch-style modal calculi.
