# Normalization for Fitch-style Modal Calculi (Artifact)

This repository contains the artifact accompanying the paper
*Normalization for Fitch-style Modal Calculi*.

## Dependencies

- [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.1/) version 2.6.2.1
- [Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/) version 1.7

## Check

To typecheck the code, run the following command line from the
repository directory:

> agda src/Everything.agda

### Assumptions

The code depends on the following two axioms:

  + Uniqueness of identity proofs (axiom K)
  + Function extensionality

Function extensionality avoids the use of setoids in the soundness
proof for the evaluation function of &lambda;<sub>IK</sub>, and axiom K allows
reasoning about values of the modal accessibility relation using
heterogeneous equality. We expect that both axioms can be dispensed
with.

## Contents

The repository contains the mechanization of the normalization
function for the calculi &lambda;<sub>IK</sub> (`src/IK/`) and &lambda;<sub>IS4</sub>
(`src/IS4/`) as described in the paper.

#### Notes:

[1]: The interpretation of types in &lambda;<sub>IK</sub> in
  lines 32-35 differs from the generic one given in Section 2 of the
  paper for the type &square;A. These are however equivalent
  interpretations in the NbE model. That is, defining ‚ü¶ &square;A
  ‚üß<sub>Œì</sub> as Œì ‚â§ Œì' ‚áí Œì' ‚óÅIK Œì'' ‚áí ‚ü¶ A ‚üß<sub>Œì''</sub> is
  equivalent to defining it as ‚ü¶ A ‚üß<sub>Œì,üîí</sub>. To observe this, we
  pick Œì for Œì' and Œì,üîí for Œì'' in one direction, and apply the
  monotonicity lemma twice in the other since Œì' ‚óÅIK Œì'' implies Œì'' ‚â§
  Œì',üîí. The latter interpretation is given by the `Box` type in line
  23.

[2]: The logical relation for &lambda;<sub>IK</sub> in the
  code is actually set up so that the fundamental theorem implies the
  stronger adequacy statement `t ‚ü∂* norm t` that terms `t` are reducible
  to their normal form `norm t` (cf. line 195). This immediately implies
  the weaker adequacy statement `t ‚âà norm t` that terms `t` are
  equivalent to their normal form `norm t`. Recall that the equational
  theory `_‚âà_` can (and is in the code) equivalently be defined as the
  reflexive&ndash;transitive&ndash;symmetric closure of the "reduction"
  relation `_‚ü∂_` (`_‚ü∂*_` denotes the merely reflexive&ndash;transitive
  closure of `_‚ü∂_`). The reduction relation is not defined in the paper
  and the logical relation for &lambda;<sub>IS4</sub> below is only set
  up to prove the weaker adequacy statement.

### Structure of the repository

The following tree gives a brief overview of the structure of the
repository with a brief description of each module.

Every path that follows is under the directory `src/`.

Modules marked with an asterisk * only reexport modules under the
directory with the same name. Modules under the directory usually
consist of a `Base` module, which contains basic definitions, and
(possibly) several other modules with specific content, for example a
`Properties` module.

Modules marked with double asterisk ** instantiate the parameters of
a more general module and export the special instances.

Some modules are shared among the mechanizations of
&lambda;<sub>IK</sub> and &lambda;<sub>IS4</sub>. They contain code
